### Overview
As we move towards providing real-time performance analytics to our leadership to help drive better IT decisions, it is imperative that we begin to standardize processes around how we manage Agile projects.

It is also important to point out where project managers have the flexibility to innovate and develop new ways to manage Agile projects.

It is an important objective of this guidance to be Agile in its own manner. This guidance is open to feedback and will be revised as our organization matures in its ability to manage agile projects.

















### Agile Scrum Terminology

|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|       Term           |                  Definition                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|    Product Owner     | The individual on the Scrum team who serves as the voice of the customer, and who has the authority to make decisions about the product or project being delivered. Owns the backlog. |
|     ScrumMaster      | Team leader responsible to help the team communicate and collaborate, to protect the team, to remove impediments, to mature the team, to coordinate outside the team, and to guide the team in following agile practices and principles. |
|      User Story      | A system requirement written from the point of view of the user or customer. Typically follows the format: “As a <who>, I want <want functionality> because <why>.” Roughly equates to a System Change Request (SCR). |
|    Epic User Story   | An Epic User Story is a requirement that is so large, that it must be broken down into smaller chunks that can be completed in a single sprint. |
|      Initiative      | An initiative is a grouping of features or User Stories that are planned out in releases. This can be roughly equated to a BCR or Business Capability Request. |
|     Release          | A deployable software package that is usually the culmination of several iteration cycles of incremental deliverables, and/or those iterations as a group. A release can be internal or external. |
|  Sprint / Iteration  | Block of time, typically one to four weeks long, in which a team plans, implements, and delivers a set of functionality.| 
















### Scrum Team Charter
All TSD DM&E Projects that are utilizing the Agile SCRUM development methodology must create an Agile SCRUM Charter that is approved by a TSD Division Branch Chief. The Charter is an extremely important document for all agile teams and serves as the basis for how the entire project is run.

    Note: Work with your Supervisor

Your Agile Scrum Team Charter must be approved by a TSD Division Branch Chief.
First and foremost, the charter is a tool for the Scrum team to define the most basic elements of how the team will organize. This is extremely important for teams that are new to the agile process and may not be familiar with all of the basic concepts like sprint cadence and definition of done. 
The charter also assists leadership in understanding expected team velocity and capacity. 

Lastly, the charter serves as a basis of understanding between the Product Owner and scrum team. This is extremely important for having a common understanding of User Acceptance Testing (UAT), as it is the number one contributor to work-in-progress loops, and blockers.

The Scrum team charter includes the following:


1. Team Definition
*       Scrum Team / Developer(s)
*       SCRUM Master
*       Business Owner(s)
5. Sprint and Release Cadences
6. Definition of Done
7. Production Release Schedule
8. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan

















###Standard Milestones and Gates

####Release Planning

> **INPUT**: Backlog / Business Requirements Document (BRD) \\
> **OUPUT**: Product Owner Approved Release Plan

Performed at the beginning of the Release cycle, Product Owners  work with the Scrum team to determine Initiatives and Features to be released.

---


####Sprint Planning

> **INPUT**: Backlog / BRD and Release Plan \\
> **OUPUT**: ScrumMaster Approved Sprint Plan

Product Owner(s) work with Scrum team to plan out individual user stories to be tackled during the sprint

---


####Demo/UAT

> **INPUT**: Completed User Stories \\
> **OUPUT**: Business Owner User Story Acceptance

Scrum team shows Product Owner(s) completed work and receives feedback that is used to create new User Stories as well as defects. Once Demo/UAT is completed, the Scrum team has their approval to promote accepted work to production.


---


####Retrospective

> **INPUT**: Completed Sprint \\
> **OUPUT**: Architectural User Stories

The Scrum team reviews the activities during the previous sprint and develop architectural user stories that help improve availability, predictability, scalability, etc… to meet the customer need.


---


####Backlog Grooming

> **INPUT**: Backlog \\
> **OUPUT**: Updated Backlog

Product Owner works with the Scrum team to define User Stories and prioritize the backlog for subsequent sprints.

* Each sprint must be baselined prior to starting. This means that all user story definitions and planning must be done prior to the sprint starting. It is a responsibility of the TSD PM to ensure that the Sprint is planned and started on time.
* Sprints must have one of the following cadences:
    *       **Monthly sprint** – Starts on the first day of the Month and ends on the last day.
    *       **Twice a month sprint** - This includes 2 equal length sprints that are performed in a single month. Sprint 1: 1st – 15th of a month, Sprint 2: 16nd – 30th of a month 
* Sprints must align to a Release.
* Sprints may be re-baselined, but must not break normal time-box. So if a re-baseline is performed mid-sprint, the re-baselined sprint can only be a half-sprint long.
* Team member capacity must be determined during sprint planning. Team member capacity should be based upon 85% of committed work hours.
* Team members should not be assigned more that 100% of their available capacity.
* If a user story is not completed and accepted at the end of a sprint, regardless of the progress the team made, it does not count towards velocity.
* If a user story is not completed at the end of a sprint, the SCRUM Master may elect to “Split” the user story into smaller user stories that can be completed over multiple sprints to claim some success. This approach should only be used when it is determined early that a user story will not be completed by the end of a sprint.
* Sprint re-baselining must be approved by the Business owner and  TSD Branch Chief. 


#### Sprint Naming Conventions

> **(PROJECT TEAM CODE) - "Sprint" (SPRINT NUMBER) - (UNIQUE NAME)**


* **Project Team Code**: Should be the short name or acronym for your project team. Examples include "AcQNav", "ITSN", and "FAaaST."
* **Sprint Number**: The Sprint Number refers to the Calendar year, month, and "part" of the sprint. For example, if your doing twice monthly sprints and this is the second sprint of the of October 2014, the release number would be 14.10.2. Sprint Number is prefixed with the word "sprint" for reporting purposes to prevent confusion with Releases.
* **Unique Name**: This can be any text to help the teams better define a Release. It is not required.



Example: 

    "ITSN - Sprint 14.10.1 - WAN Reports" (This would be the October 2014 Sprint from the ITSN Team)








### Release Management

A release is a deployable software package that is usually the culmination of several iteration cycles of incremental deliverables, and/or those iterations as a group. A release can be internal or external.


#### General Guidance


* Each release must be baselined prior to starting. This means that all features, themes, initiatives, and/or program epics must be defined prior to the start of the release. It is a responsibility of the TSD PM to ensure that the release is planned and started on time.
* All releases should follow a cadence that maps to a calendar month. Starting on the first day of a month, and ending on the last day of that or a subsequent month.
* Regular releases may not be longer than 3 months, and should not be shorter than 1 month.
* Regular releases occur off hours and outside of normal sprint planning.
* Releases should be named based upon the calendar month of the release.
Features must be assigned to release.
* User Stories must be at least defined in order to place in a release.

#### Naming Conventions

>**(PROJECT TEAM CODE) - "Release" (RELEASE NUMBER) - (UNIQUE NAME)**

* Project Team Code: Should be the short name or acronym for your project team. Examples include "AcQNav", "ITSN", and "FAaaST."
* Release Number: The Release Number refers to the Calendar Month and year of the last month of the release cycle. For example, if your doing a quarterly release for the 1st calendar quarter in 2014, the release number would be 14.3. 3 refers to March, which is the last month in the release cycle. Release Number is prefixed with the word "release" for reporting purposes to prevent confusion with sprints..
* Unique Name: This can be any text to help the teams better define a Release. It is not required

Example:
    
    "ITSN - Release 14.10 - Split-Match" (This would be the October 2014 release from the ITSN Team)
